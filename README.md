# Automated-Text-Generation-Using-NLP
Text Summarization Function:

Developed a text summarising tool utilising Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches.
Libraries such as spaCy were used for text preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, and part-of-speech tagging), and transformers (particularly TFAutoModelForSeq2SeqLM) for sophisticated sequence-to-sequence modelling.
I created a summarising pipeline that uses a pre-trained model to generate short summaries from incoming text (t5-base).

Raphical User Interface (GUI) Development:

Designed and built a GUI with tkinter, Python's standard GUI module.
Included widgets are Text for text input/output, Button for initiating actions such as text summarization, and messagebox for user alerts (e.g., error warnings).
Customised the GUI with features such as scrollable text regions (scrolledtext) and visually attractive layouts.

Integration of NLP with GUI:

Added text summarization capability to the GUI application.
Allows users to enter text, trigger summarising, and view the summarised result via the GUI.
To guarantee robust user interaction, we handled edge circumstances such as empty input validation.

In essence, the project required employing NLP approaches for text summarising and integrating this capability into a user-friendly GUI with Python's tkinter library. 
The project's goal was to offer users with an easy interface for summarising text input, supported by powerful NLP algorithms, while also investigating ways to improve visual appeal and considering deployment alternatives for greater accessibility.
